Implemented a Machine Learning and IoT-based system for automatic weed detection and cutting. This project aimed to 
develop an Automatic Weed Detection and Cutting system using Machine Learning (ML) and Internet of Things (IoT) 
technologies. 
In this project, I took on the responsibility of developing and fine-tuning the ML algorithms for weed detection.  
This involved pre-processing image data, training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using Tensor Flow and Keras, 
and optimizing the models for real-time performance on embedded devices. 
I also played a key role in integrating the ML models with the IoT devices, ensuring seamless communication and 
control between the system components. This required me to work closely with hardware engineers to implement sensor 
data acquisition and actuator control logic.
